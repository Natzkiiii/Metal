# Metal
A small coding language i work on from time to time

Metal is written mostly in c++ with some unique things being written in Java, JS, or other languages.
Metal itself is simply for tesing my knowledge over programming langauges itself and how much i know about them.
Metal is not supposed to be a replacement for large programming languages like: python, java, javascript, c, c++, etc.

This project is simply there when i don't know what to do.
